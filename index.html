					<h1>Serving size</h1><br>
					<p> One of the most noticeable differences between western<br>
 						and eastern food is serving size. Compared with traditional<br>
						eastern dishes, western serving sizes are much larger and<br>
						sizes that are considered larger in eastern cultures appear<br>
						only regular sized to westerners.</p>

					<h1>Ingredients</h1><br>
					<p>In western cooking, rice is often treated the same way<br>
					 	as steamed vegetables and 	mashed potatoes. To contrast<br>
						this, most eastern meals aren’t complete without rice. <br>
						Sometimes noodles can replace rice, but many recipes will <br>
						incorporate both ingredients if it can.</p>

					<h1>Seasoning</h1><br>
					<p>Western cooking puts a great deal of emphasis on the use of seasonings and condiments.<br>
					 All western eating establishments have a wide array of sauces and seasonings including<br>
					 ketchup, gravy and mustard. Eastern food uses its fair share of seasoning as well, including<br>
					 basil, cinnamon, cilantro, coriander, cloves, lemongrass, garlic and ginger to name a few.<br>
					 Eastern cuisine also uses many sweet sauces, like soy sauce, in a lot of its dishes.</p><br><br><br><br>
					<h1>Flavours</h1><br>
					<p>In western cuisine there is an emphasis placed on looking for ingredients that “pair” with<br>
					 each other. This means that western dishes seek to create a controlled flavour palate that<br>
					 is very similar from start to finish. This approach is flipped on its head in eastern cuisine,<br>
					 which seeks to combine as many different and contrasting flavours as possible. This is why<br>
					 so many people find eastern dishes to be a vibrant mix of flavour sensations that keeps<br>
					 them coming back for more.</p>

					<h1>Home cook</h1><br>
					<hr><br>
					<p>This strikes me as mostly right but too starkly drawn. Obviously home cooks<br>
						are not precluded by “the ethics of the home kitchen” from optimizing flavor <br>
						and honoring their ingredients by producing “complex, original, stimulating<br>
						cuisine”. They have some duty, to the best of their resources and ability, to<br>
						create good food. Similarly, restaurant chefs cannot ignore their duty to<br>
						create a convivial atmosphere or to establish a relationship of trust between<br>
						chef and diner.<br><br>
						The home kitchen and the home cook, on the other hand, have a duty to cook <br>
						for the diner out of love and friendship …. The home cook’s intent values a <br>
						fostering of comfort, providing abundance, and creating a dining atmosphere <br>
						of conviviality. The ethics of the home kitchen place emphasis on honoring <br>
						the diners first (and the food itself second) and accomplishing this by <br>
						promoting an inclusive fraternity of the kitchen where cook and diner interact <br>
						either at the stove or á table.

						<h1>Professional chefs</h1><br>
						<hr><br>
						<p>Professional chefs must create food that is surprising, challenging <br>
							and that provides a new perspective or experience.  Their goal is <br>
							entertainment. The home cook must create food that is pleasing <br>
							but accessible, comprehensible, and digestible, to avoid offense <br>
							and discomfort. Their goal is friendship. The home cook can <br>
							surprise and challenge, but only within the limits of what will <br>
							sustain friendship. The restaurant chef can take more liberties <br>
							but of course must be careful not to get too far out in front of the <br>
							diners or she will find herself out of business. <br><br>
						A restaurant kitchen, and those who produce its food, in the absence <br>
						of a direct and personal relationship with the diner, have a specific <br>
						duty to cook “to the food.” This means that they should intend to <br>
						create food that is artfully made using expert techniques, drawing <br>
						out optimal flavor, texture, and color, and in which the ingredients <br>
						often produce complex, original and stimulating cuisine.</p>
